Title of the Project: budaya.KU

Executive Summary:
Indonesian culture is threatened with extinction due to globalization that is contributing to the
weakening of indonesian cultural value. Our research questions consist of :How do you preserve
Indonesian traditional culture? Many ways such as studying local culture, making culture a national
identity, not being influenced by foreign culture and introducing traditional culture to the young
generation of Indonesia. What can be done to solve this cultural crisis problem? We make an
application that applies 3 technologies based on Tensorflow, Android and Cloud systematically so
that the application we create can help educate about culture in Indonesia.
Project Scope
1. Build dataset for Machine Learning classification object
2. The web application will be written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
3. The Android application will be written in Kotlin and built using Android Studio
4. Deploy the machine learning model to Android and website applications
5. The Android application will be written in Kotlin and built using Android Studio
6. GCP used and create Virtual Machine and host application server
7. make application desain, hosting application web and mobile
8. creates a system interactive

Risk and Issue Management Plan:
Management:
1. Failing to keep up with weekly milestones. Solution: Weekly meeting to maintain progress and
other team members can help each other.
2. Team members missing out on weekly video meetings. Solution: Record and create a
summary of the meeting.
Technical:
1. Web server crashing. Solution: Create backup server on GCP.
2. Slow machine learning model training speed. Solution: Use Google Colab or GCP.
3. Laptop lagging.
4. Network Error
External:
1. Force majeure (flood, earthquake, tsunami, etc).
2. Sickness (Covid-19, Flu, etc).
3. Family feud
